  == Development Environment ==
  * KEILMDK Version 5.12 or above.
  * Programmer/Debugger: ST-LINK V2
  * Programming/Debugginginterface: JTAG/SWD
  
  == How to use ==
  1. Plug the LCD display to the LCD port.
  2. Connect the board to your PC with a DP83848 Ethernet Board via ETH interface.
  3(*). Connect the Analog Test Board to the board using jumper wires: 
     where, 
       * VCC --> 3.3V, 
       * GND --> GND 
       * ADCx --> PA6
  4. Power up and the display indicates the Dynamic Host IP.
  5. Enter the IP in your broswer.
  6. Click "Led control" to control LED1 and LED2(*).
  7. Click "ADC status bar" to get the ADC 1 Channel 6 analog input converted value. 
     * Rotate the potentiometer position on the Analog Test Board to change voltage output.

  === Remarks ===
  * By default the LED3 and LED4 are connected to PD14 and PD15. 
    However, PD14 and PD15 are remapped to FSMC_D0 and FSMC_D1 for liquid crystal display. 
    So the demo uses PA12 and PA13 as an alternative. Meanwhile the PA12 and PA13 pins will 
    be HIGH level if you check LED3 and LED4 and submit.
  * The PA7 pin is alternatively used for ETH_CCRS_DV, so don't plug the Analog Test Board 
    to the "ADC + DAC" interface, or else the ETH won't work properly. 
  
  == Attention ==
  * If the source code is generated by the STM32CubeMX again, there might be some undefined 
    symbols. This bug may be solved in the future version of STM32CubeMX but now (Feb. 13 2017),
    to solve the problem, you should manually modify:
    Append these lines to stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h:
      #define PHY_MICR                        ((uint16_t)0x11U)    /*!< MII Interrupt Control Register                  */
      #define PHY_MISR                        ((uint16_t)0x12U)    /*!< MII Interrupt Status and Misc. Control Register */
      
      #define PHY_LINK_STATUS                 ((uint16_t)0x0001U)  /*!< PHY Link mask                                   */
      
      #define PHY_MICR_INT_EN                 ((uint16_t)0x0002U)  /*!< PHY Enable interrupts                           */
      #define PHY_MICR_INT_OE                 ((uint16_t)0x0002U)  /*!< PHY Enable output interrupt events              */
      
      #define PHY_MISR_LINK_INT_EN            ((uint16_t)0x0020U)  /*!< Enable Interrupt on change of link status       */
      #define PHY_LINK_INTERRUPT              ((uint16_t)0x2000U)  /*!< PHY link status interrupt mask                  */
    
  */
